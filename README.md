# Active-Directory-Lab
<h2>Objective</h2>

The Active-Directory Lab project aims to establish a controlled environment for simulating and controlling a domain with 1000 randomly generated users. The primary focus for this lab was to get a direct feel of creating a domain, populating the domain with users by running a Powershell script that pulls from a name text file and makes the users within our domain, and finally managing the created users as an administrator. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen my understanding of creating and managing a domain, using Powershell scripts, and navigating the various features of Active Directory. 

<h2>Skills Learned</h2>
<ul><li>Advanced Understanding of Active Directory,</li>
    <li>Proficiency in utilizing Powershell scripting to populate our Users OU.</li>
    <li>Ability to generate and manage the different Organizational Units (OU) within our environment. </li>
    <li>Enhanced knowledge of creating domains and managing them.</li>
</ul>
